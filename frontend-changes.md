## Features Implemented

### 1. Toggle Button Design
- Clean, circular icon-based design that fits the existing aesthetic
- Positioned in header top-right corner
- Uses sun icon for light mode and moon icon for dark mode
- Smooth rotation and scale animations when switching
- Accessible with keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter/Space)
- Proper focus indicators for accessibility

### 2. Light Theme Color Scheme
- Light backgrounds (#f8fafc, #ffffff) for reduced eye strain in bright environments
- Dark text (#0f172a, #64748b) for excellent contrast and readability
- Maintained primary blue accent color (#2563eb) for consistency
- Adjusted shadows and borders for light mode aesthetics
- All colors meet WCAG accessibility standards for contrast

### 3. JavaScript Functionality
- Detects and applies saved theme preference on page load
- Toggles theme on button click or keyboard activation
- Stores preference in localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Smooth transitions between themes using CSS
- Defaults to dark mode if no preference is saved

### 4. Implementation Details
- Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theme management
- `data-theme="light"` attribute on `<html>` element triggers light mode
- No attribute (or `data-theme="dark"`) uses default dark mode
- All existing UI elements (sidebar, messages, buttons, inputs) adapt to both themes
- Maintains visual hierarchy and design language across both themes
- Smooth 0.3s transitions prevent jarring theme switches

## User Experience

### Theme Persistence
- User's theme choice is saved in browser localStorage
- Preference automatically loads on subsequent visits
- Each user can have their own theme preference per browser/device

### Smooth Transitions
- All color changes animate smoothly over 300ms
- Icon changes include rotation and scale effects
- Button provides visual feedback on hover and focus
- No layout shifts or jarring color changes

### Accessibility
- Button is keyboard accessible (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to activate)
- Proper ARIA label: "Toggle theme"
- High contrast ratios in both themes
- Focus indicators clearly visible
- Icons provide clear visual feedback of current theme

## Testing Performed
- Verified server serves updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Confirmed theme toggle button renders with correct SVG icons
- Validated CSS variables for both dark and light themes
- Tested JavaScript theme functions are properly loaded
- Confirmed smooth transitions work across all UI elements

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting CSS custom properties
- localStorage API for theme persistence
- CSS transitions for smooth theme switching
- SVG support for icons

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- System theme detection (prefers-color-scheme media query)
- Additional theme options (high contrast, custom colors)
- Theme-aware syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Animated theme transition effects
